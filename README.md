<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Any system that exhibits periodic motion and has a restoring force that is linear with regard to the magnitude of its disturbance (i.e a mass attached to a spring) is considered a harmonic oscillator.  This harmonic oscillator simulator allows you to visualize the position wave function of a harmonic oscillator while simultaneously allowing you to vary multiple input parameters such as the amplitude, frequency, and damping ratio.</p>
